LaTeX Notes

This Chinese document is an introduction to TeX/LaTeX. It covers basic text typesetting, math, graphics, table, Chinese language & fonts, and some miscellaneous features (hyperlink, long document, bibliography, index, page layout).

This package contains six files: 
readme.txt
history.txt
license.txt
lnotes.dvi
lnotes.pdf
src.zip

The source files are encoded in UTF-8.

This readme is in English because CTAN websites support only ASCII readmes.

Any comments are welcome. I could be accessed at TeX board of smth.org or by email.
